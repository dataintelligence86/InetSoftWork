aggregates and the worksheet versus in the dashboard.
 the main benefit of Leaving the data very transactional and detail level is that you can have various dashboard elements grouping and aggregating the data in different ways without having to work around the pre-summarization happening in the data layer. hypothetically, if you have, a certain combination of dimensions of ways of grouping the data and you use them together and then hang of the data averaging across that You wouldn't then? At the dashboard level. Being trying to also look at account of the records.
You wouldn't also be looking at sums of the records because if you were then to group the data in the chart, with only some of the dimensions that were used in the grouping in summarization happening beforehand. You would then be summing on an average, not summing on the individual transactions. So certain layers of calculations would not make sense. It would make the data less flexible. Just impulsively, making design choices and letting the recommender, give you various different options because what if a calculation is in contrast to how you grouped and summarized it before it was hitting the dashboard If you let it be more transactional, more detailed, you're then just allowing that individual cross tab to summarize the data.
 And factor in any filter components. That might be trimming the data on demand, etc. So that is a benefit to Having the Free group to summerized either. From a database perspective that's feeding in from an API that's feeding the data to us because sometimes you have the external source that we're pulling from is pre-calculating stuff and sending us pre-calculated stuff. That means that your Pre-calculated value that. I'm pulling in here if I pull up the show details. Maybe it's not really truly details. Maybe I can't get down to the individual amounts for a particular, order or whatever it is, because it's not available to us. You're selling yourself short, in that flexibility. the benefits of having the data free groups and summarized
Whether it's, because, The data source that you're querying, you may be already have in your say SQL. It's pretty, it's telling the database to presummarize, the data before it comes back to us. Maybe it's that you're pointing to A database view. So the database itself has already pre summarized the data in the way it's storing it. Maybe you're connecting to an API somewhere and the API is already calculating things. There are some benefits. If you have very specific industry calculations, That you need to have done. With a certain whole data perspective. And you need to very carefully regulate. The way those calculations are done, having them done, at your database level, through your custom API. What you're working with?
 Alleviates the need. To audit every single design, a user's, creating to make sure that they are adhering to all of those calculation. Requirements. And it also allows for if there is a change, you're then changing it back at that one place and not having to come into a ton of handcrafted sequel Or to the particular dashboards changing. The way the calculation is done, maybe through expression columns and so on. However, when spree calculated, you're going to lose out on that benefit of the show details etc. The benefit of having data may be pre-calculated in the way. It's coming to ISSOFT, it can reduce data volume being sentine at soft. So, in certain circumstances with  Data that you never really need to look at the transactional level, from a user perspective, they never want to look at it at the transactional level. And there are certain levels of calculations that you're always going to be looking to have the develop that you can reduce Basically, the traffic between and inetsoft and your data source by having US request, maybe free grouped and summarized data in some way. It'll have to send over less records, right? Because they're already Presummarized, 10,000 records could be a hundred records, then Or maybe it's like, 500 records or 5,000 records, but it could also be the magnitude of it was a hundred million records. And now, it's only eight million records, right? That are being sent to it. you can actually have a data volume reduction.

we do have the materialized views, the ability to pre-cache the data for the dashboards. So that way the users aren't waiting for such large data volume requests that they can work off of. the fact that we grab the data ahead of time. The other. When would I group in aggregate at the worksheet level? In some cases has to do with
Katie Roussey: You wanting to mash up or combine data? That exists at different levels of detail. So, if I were to build you a for instance,
and I have all this actual sales data and by hypothetical these sales have ordered numbers. They're on various dates for within various product categories. There's particular prices. So maybe this we wouldn't worry about the reorder level. And certain details here. So, maybe I have That is sales data.
Or I have leads data, I have, some aspect of data where I have very detailed level data. And then, I am also in a secondary data source, here. Aren't going to give me what I need here. So I'm just going to make a little embedded table. That'll just have for instance, here for you. So, if I had three columns here, So let's imagine that this was a query going against some other thing. Maybe it's a Google Sheet that is maintained somewhere. In many cases we've been dealing with. It's been something that's like an Excel file. That's maintained somewhere because you might have things. You have. For our order level quarter level. Sales goals. for instance, when I have So I should probably make sure that in this one I have which sales rep. Did sales So we get to Robert. Annie and right.
 And that if I were to have this data at a quarter level, My quarter level would be. A 101 2024 for the first quarter. And then it would be. four One twenty twenty four. So April, 1st becomes the date equivalent for the secondary quarter So you have the data basically lined up at the quarter level and you have some kind of, amounts in here. Whatever they are. If it's supposed to be counts or So on. So I just have to make sure that this is An Integer, but many cases You have something like budgetary amounts that people discuss and they have detailed meetings about or whatever you have this data at this quarter level.
Katie Roussey: so, in some cases, You can very easily compare individual transactions to sales goals just through simple join, that's no problem. In this case, we align At the first name. So, that's the sale and the reps name. And we say Great, sure, The problem is that I had quarterly. But this I had individual dates, so I'm not really lining up on that so the data doesn't line up In this hypothetical. So now Sue's data is duplicated because I happen to have a second quarter in here for her. So I'm getting kind of like a mismatch there. So instead I need to for this data. To line up on the quarter, I either have to have an expression column that transposes my date to the particular quarter, it aligns on because I want to maintain my transactional data. However,
It's then harder I have this value. That's then repeated, for every record of sues for the first quarter. So I wouldn't sum on this column in charts, I would need to make sure I take a max in perspective of her a average or so I have to look at how I would then transactionally take a duplicated value that's duplicated for all of the detail records for Sue for that quarter. When I'm doing my chart or I can do something very simple. And that is to My data. So I would take my distinct count of my orders and I would take my date and I would line it up two quarter and I would still group by category by name by Sku. And then I would take My quantities and my totals. And if I wanted to make sure that I still had a note.
so typically I would look at Either doing a min or max a first, or a last, or an average, when looking at a price that's repeated for multiple rows, because you have the same product repeated multiple times, potentially but it's a way to make sure that the price doesn't get inflated. Where you're in a way taking it once. So, if I were to look to group and summarize this data,
And I want to then in this case, kind of line up. I would make sure that for reps for this, what I should set this to be a date first.
 I should have said the purse thing because it didn't take Column type. date normally you'd be reading this in from
So, if I were to,Grab this. To make sure they're in the same format here. Yes, I'm sure.
 So when I'm actually doing my join, I am aligning up on the quarter of when the purchase, was paid to the quarter of their goal. And so now my data is completely free summarized but I'm going to get for maybe they're overall amount, maybe I can't look at the individuals sales goals because my data is not broken down for my goals by category and by product, So, I'm still dealing with a mixture of detail, so this is the same value repeated for her, for all of the various quantities because I did still maintain my orders and have my count of orders with my quantities, with my amounts, for my individual product name. So, this is where you're dealing with a mixture of granularity. So in some cases to prevent calculation, miss mismatch, what people will do is they will completely remove the level of detail. That is available. To only. Look at totals. For the rep completely clearing out the detail. Once I do that, what you'll notice is now all of a sudden there's 64 rows. This is pre summarized at the level that's in alignment with this. And so you're going to be able to line up your data very easily. To now, do some kind of calculation between your quantities and your shell go quantities. And you can then very easily do. Calculated fields. That are doing it across here, or you can just easily plot these side-by-side on a chart. And you don't have to worry about, if I sum on this column, it's now super inflated. How do I make sure I take the value once? While still, aggregating, it has to do with mixture of detail.
 When you have a mixture of detail levels in your raw data and you're combining data from more than one source. And the most common thing is some kind of goal or budget. Target where they don't want the target repeated. For every transactional detail, they actually want to roll up their detail. In alignment with how their data is broken down for that Target that they're doing. To then do the mashup. That is the most common reason to do grouping and summarization. Another common reason to do grouping and summarization at the worksheet level. is because you are looking to have to do a step through calculation. Where you needed this instead of being a sum be like a MAX for the relative range of time or category or type and then that max needs to be brought to a pre summarized level that's at some other type of calculation, from a completely different separation. And I need to now do math out of the max value. What is the current count for certain way of doing a ratio? Instead of doing, a percent of grand total? Because maybe a percent of grand total isn't the specific way. You need the calculation done. I'm really struggling to come up with a very generic way to say this, but I've seen certain tegral calculus level calculations that are required for certain industries. where they needed the data grouped up at a certain level so that way they got their sums, their amounts, and their quantities, and then they need to do some kind of ratio calculation to then take that ratio calculation and apply it back to detail level data or apply it back to A different aggregate level data so they They need Aggregation that have an expression field that was doing some calculations to that mash it up to some kind of detail level as So in most cases why would I group an aggregate at the worksheet level? It is either to align Data coming from different locations. That is at different level of detail versus already aggregated in some way to prevent double counting or to prevent double-summing of a value. So you pre-summerise it at the worksheet level to perform a mashup. So that way you can get data from these different situations side by side to use it and combine displays. Or it's because you have a very sophisticated step through calculation that you need done in stages that maybe you have any to not have it pushed back to your original system where the data is coming from. As I said, a lot of people will have those types of calculations already done at the database level, right or back behind their API, and they're already feeding us, the pre-calculated values. But in some cases, they can't. Because the data is only going to come out of whatever system that we're connecting to an API from at a detailed level. and so, they need to  to then take through a second level of calculation, that's grouped and aggregated at a different way. And normally it has to do with very specific industries, having very specific. Either risk calculations. Chemical ratio calculations. where they're looking at volume and amounts and tolerance levels. So you have those very sophisticated industry type calculations that are not just simple. Counts of leads.

So, it might be really hard to. Give a specific for instance for grouping and some to then do a next level of grouping and some to then do another level of calculation. Kind of like to make sure you get a final calculated value to display at the dashboard trying to come up with something that's, not going to be too specific to alignment with a specific customer that we already have. That might then see that. We actually kind of use their use case when there's possibly an NDA in place would probably not be good.

 So it's kind of hard to give you a generic, for instance, for that concept of a step through calculation. But we have had customers where because the type of data source we were connecting to it was only going to give us the data at the certain level so they weren't going to be calculating it for us, So then that meant we had a calculated on our side and the only way to do the layered calculation that they wanted was to presummarize at a certain level. So imagine if this data I grouped it At product category, first. And had my totals for product category. And then I did some kind of calculation with it at the product category, slash sales, rep level. And then  I Average across it for the account. Rep here. And then did another calculation level? And then summed it and then put it on a chart. We have some customers that are doing that kind of layered Grouping it broader with more detail maintained doing a calculation at that level, that included some averages and stuff. So it's not just straight sums divided by sums. you have to look at pemdas and parentheses. And if I were to Sums the I can't average the sums like you can't do certain things in certain orders because mathematically they are not equivalent. 
 
 So you have to do it at a certain level first and then you have to do a next layer of calculation and then a next layer of calculation. And sometimes we have to do it in our software because the data source that they're pulling it from doesn't provide the data. grouped, and summarized So the tool lets you do it and it lets you do it off of mashed up data. Right? That could be pulling for more than once worse, but the most common reason, To have aggregation. In a worksheet is because you're trying to do a very simple.

 Perspective of some actuals. whether it's actual lead harvesting, actual conversions of leads actual sales amounts actual payouts for insurances or actual costs of things compared to an overall quarterly budget or department level budget, or Target for reps or targets for departments, or whatever it is, where you just pre-summerise the data at the combination of date. Location person. So it lines up with that budgetary, target, whatever, data very easily for you to line it up and not have to deal with some kind of duplicate inflated double counting, double summing potential situation, for ease of just popping on a chart. Popping it up on visual.
 in general from a high level. Showing you if I only joined it on rep, you get data duplication and if I left this at the detail level, Joining it up to this without having Only summarized at the rep level. These metrics, right? The data this was getting repeated. So then it's harder to use in a simple chart across tab visual because it's going to try to like some How do I make sure that I'm only showing the value once? So it's not getting inflated in some way to, then compare to, some kind of actual amounts. That's the most common reason to do grouping, at aggregation at the worksheet level, is for that type of comparative analysis, pulling the data from two different sources, that's at a mixture of Granularity, and you're wanting to Make sure that the binding and the math that the dashboard level is as simple and straightforward as possible.

 biggest reason to leave it to the dashboard level.
 Because You don't have this need for very Step to Step Calculation, and you don't have a need to combine data at different levels of granularity, and you don't have a need to leave some of the detail out because you want to reduce the date of Flowing to init Every time a dashboard is requesting data. If you're not doing any of those three things, Let the detail be there. So that way, the user can fully experience the show details and you can very easily just Go and be the most flexible with. Hey, let me just look at an average here. Let me look at a distinct, count. Your data is a pre summarized, in some way. And you're not doing a mismatch of calculation on a particular field, you can just let the raw details, just flow into the calculations, giving the user, the most flexibility when designing the dashboard and making those choices about the calculations on the metric picking and so on, if this quantities was already on a certain level lculated performing, certain other types of calculations on that pre-calculated data would lead to Valid calculation output. instead the data is left at that more, Raw detail level. It gives the person designing the dashboard most flexibility to change their mind as to what calculation is going to give the end user consuming this dashboard The grade is knowledge. you still always then when you do the show details, you're actually going to get down to those details. You're not losing out on that. in terms of having it, just go back to summarized data and getting one row back for the single row, you're displaying, instead of getting 30 rows, or 300 rows, and you're going to have the benefit of An end user doing that. Self-service option of Hey let me edit the binding of this crosstab or this chart. That when they're in there, working with the columns that they can? Feel free to pick and to change up all the calculation levels and not have to. Potentially run into the situation where that level of details just not there for them to select and see in the self-service level of the dashboard as well.

So, there's only three real reasons to do the grouping and aggregation. Behind the scenes.
Katie Roussey: The rest of the time we want to encourage them to have the detail so that way they can have the most flexibility the For changing their mind and design and not having to go back and refactor their grouping in aggregation.
Katie Roussey: so, that way, just Any time they design stuff know that that show details is really going to actually pull up some details for them and not just pull up free aggregated data. Because there are a lot of clients that we've had. They come in to make a dashboard. And they go, I've made my carefully. Curated sequel query. And the query is still. grouped presumed level. That it's then only good for one chart. And one gauge and they go. I also want to show this other bit of data.  But I guess that means, and then they come back to their sequel and then they edit their sequel. And then they add in some more and they add in the level of detail in the. And then they go back to their chart and just the calculation there because they change and they made the sequel expose more. I'm like, Why don't you just do? Yes. The joins between your tables? Yes. maybe certain pre-filtering because you only want in the last 12 months later, the last three months of data, like you want to focus on West Coast, whatever it is. But just let it pull. The order details, Or the lead details, don't force it to counting the data preemptively or summing the data preemptively because then it gives you the flexibility of showing the individual order or the individual leads and their details and And allowing the user. with that show details, actually CD tells it gives you the flexibility of changing your mind a little bit on the dashboard design and not having to go. my gosh. I already factored out that level of detail Because I felt that I should give you a carefully. Curated sequel, that does pre-grouping and aggregation. In many cases. People do that. and they lose out on some of that flexibility, because the reason why In their data requests to their data source. Or in this case, most of the cases, it's a large relational database with a lot of historical data. The reason why they do that, is because they do in some cases have A real fundamental data volume reduction needs. Sure, go ahead and do that.

 But in most cases because they're doing certain things to focus that dashboard, they don't really have that need and they aren't mixing granularity of data. They don't have a fancy step through calculation that don't Embrace the detail data. So that way the dashboard can provide the user as much flexibility in the self-service. So that way when you come in and you're like, I really want to work with that data set again. But I didn't need a count of the orders. I really just wanted to do a distinct count instead? No I don't have to come in here and change and provide a secondary worksheet that has the same joins but with a calculation change or no, if it was more detailed data, reuse that worksheet, Have one worksheet, feed for dashboards, you're gonna get that flexibility too. When you have it more detail, level data coming back, as long as there is not a concern. About overall data volume coming back and forth upon every dashboard request. And again, then maybe you actually look at our materialized view option to have us, pold the data for certain dashboards so that way you can still have that true transactional detail level data And not, potentially cripple that flexibility of the show details and the hey let me just impulsively make these ad hoc changes and create a bookmark or hey let me just reuse this worksheet. Because it has everything I need in it already. I don't need to create a second.
 Such as slight difference in the way, it's doing things kind of query block and having a separate worksheet for no, let the query open a little bit more detailed. So that way you can get that reasonability out of it.
so, Because the amount of times the people come in, they're like, I gotta come in, I gotta change my little handcrafted sequel and why don't you let it be little bit more, open-ended a little bit more just detail. So then you can just make some changes and your charts and not have to constantly go back and refactor your query because that just doesn't save you time at all. You leave some flexibility here in the detail. We're working with And it gives you a lot more reusability. And flexibility when making design changes or adjustments for your dashboard vision as…
Ben Williams: Here. So I'm

 they'll just make such very specific Query requests and they're not dealing with extreme data volume and don't really have a need. To have the data regrouped and summarize and then they're just like, I'm not sure what else to visualize and they may be in this circumstance. We're making sure they were returning this level of detail. How many visuals you're gonna get out of this? There are three columns. What are you doing? Maybe it is because you have to do some kind of sales goal or something, but many cases, they're taking the level of detail that you could have with the order with the quantities with the prices, and they're pre summarizing it on such a level.

 Because they knew that they wanted one chart to have that presentation. It's like no leave it more detailed. And then let the dashboard just grow in inspiration and design. Don't pigeonhole yourself with pre-grouping and summarization, only do the pre-grouping and summarization for those three fundamental reasons.

SUMMARY
