# How to use the Date Comparison Feature


InetSoft’s tool provides a way for users to compare data across various ranges, such as comparing specific months, days, and years.


 To use the date comparison feature, click the … icon at the top right of a chart or table, or right click anywhere if you are dealing with a chart.
