# Comparing Custom Periods

For this example of comparing dates on custom periods, we will use a chart displaying the number of unfilled jobs per month at a temp agency, with an average of all months already provided.

Right click on the chart, and click 'Date Comparison'. Select the tab 'Custom Periods'

The 'Standard Periods' tab has options to cover most date comparison use cases, however sometimes it is necessary to manually set the comparison periods. In this example, we will be comparing two month long periods that start and end on different days of the month. Enter the start date and end date of the comparison periods (you may enter as many as you like) and select granularity. In this instance, we will be selecting "All" to compare the totals of both custom periods. Press 'Ok'.

As you can see, the chart has updated to display both custom periods as blocks of distinct colors, for easy comparison.
