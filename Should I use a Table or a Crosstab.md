# Should I use a table or a crosstab?

 You can begin your search for the ideal chart oubput by making a note of what our product would assume by using InetSoft's Visualization Reccomender. This is the option that first appears when you create a dashboard. It selects an ideal dashboard output option based on which columns from the dataset are selected. 
 
 The first thing that the wizard Recommender consider is whether or not you're working with a dimension versus a measure. Selecting a dimension automatically results in a chart. So if you're just grabbing a simple text phrased field, it's going to automatically do a chart. However, If you start introducing additional dimensions. And you get to a third dimension it may suggest a crosstab table.
